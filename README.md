## How To Run
- Make sure to have [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your machine.
- Next, you need to have [react-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native) installed, you can run `npm install -g react-native` or `yarn global add react-native`.
- Next is to have your environment set up, since the steps is quite long, I will refer the environment setup to [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) link.
- After everything installed, you can open a command window in this project repository and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the required node_modules.
- Then, by having your device connected or your virtual device running, you can type `npx react-native start` and `npx react-native run-android` to start the app.
